Born in Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· , I always had the dream of being a soccer player like a lot of kids, but it was a goal I could not achieve. When I was 17, I initiated a technical programming course that changed my future perspectives. I fell in love with this world of infinite possibilities, which allowed me to evolve as a person and developer.

In this short period, I did create many projects and have had experience in technologies like RPA, Salesforce, IoT, and IA, which could prepare me for different challenges in my developer career. If you want to know about some of these projects, you can access my [portfolio website](https://ocarmo.dev) and my [digital garden](https://knowledge.ocarmo.dev), which are locals where I like to share practical examples and notes.

In 2022, I graduated from my dream university, where I met amazing professionals, developed an AI to help teenagers, and showed it to investors at a big event.

## Nowadays I code with:

- Typescript
- Rust
- React.js
- Next.js
- Mongodb
- GraphQL

## Even I love to code, I always had hobbies, like:

- Draw
- Soccer
- Watch old movies
- Video Games

If you want to talk, I'm always on Twitter or LinkedIn, be comfortable contacting me there.
